# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- The license badge in the README no longer renders as a broken image. It used
  the GitHub-API-backed shields.io endpoint, which can fail to answer; since
  the license never changes, it is now a static badge.
- Release notes on GitHub no longer show ragged mid-sentence line breaks.
  `CHANGELOG.md` is hard-wrapped at ~80 columns, and GitHub renders release
  bodies with hard line breaks (every newline becomes a `<br>`), unlike `.md`
  files in the repo. The release workflow now unwraps paragraphs before
  publishing them.

### Changed
- README: documented that the card is available directly in HACS, with install
  steps that no longer mention adding a custom repository, and the badge now
  reads "HACS Default" instead of "HACS Custom".

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-25

### Changed
- The card is now a single self-contained bundle. `dist/puffer-card.js` is
  generated from `src/` with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) instead of
  being hand-written, and includes everything it needs at runtime.
- Lit is bundled into the card instead of being imported from a CDN
  (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`) on first load. The card now works on installations
  without internet access, no longer depends on a third-party host staying
  available, and loads one fewer external resource. Despite embedding Lit, the
  built file is slightly smaller than the previous hand-written source.
- Translations are compiled into the bundle instead of being fetched at runtime
  from `dist/translations/`. Language lookups are synchronous, so the editor
  and the card no longer re-render once translations arrive.
- Translation sources moved from `dist/translations/` to `src/translations/`,
  with `src/i18n.js` as the single registry of shipped languages.
- The version string is injected at build time from the git tag, removing the
  manual step of keeping the `VERSION` constant in sync before tagging.
- `scripts/check-translations.js` now validates the new layout: that
  `src/i18n.js` and `src/translations/` agree with each other, and that every
  language is actually present in the built bundle.
- **Manual installs:** copying `dist/puffer-card.js` on its own is now enough.
  The `translations/` folder next to it is no longer read and can be deleted.
  HACS installs are unaffected and upgrade normally.

### Removed
- `dist/translations/` (moved to `src/translations/` and bundled).
- `dist/translations/index.json`: the list of shipped languages now lives in
  `src/i18n.js`, so there is no second manifest that can fall out of sync.
- The inline `FALLBACK_EN` table in the source. `en.json` is guaranteed to be
  in the bundle, so the duplicate copy of the English strings — which could
  silently drift from `en.json` — is no longer needed.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- Fourth optional sensor position (`extra`), sitting between `middle` and
  `bottom`. Fully backward compatible: existing configs with only
  `top`/`middle`/`bottom` render pixel-identical to before — the extra
  slot is simply left unconfigured. With all four positions set, the tank
  (normal layout) grows taller and badge text shrinks slightly so nothing
  overlaps; both layouts get slightly smaller fonts in this case.
- Side pipes in the normal layout now follow the number of configured
  sensors (1 to 4), each centered on its sensor's height, instead of a
  fixed pair of decorative pipes.
- A 4th fixed chart color (teal) so a 4-sensor history chart never repeats
  a color between series.
- `dist/translations/index.json`, a manifest listing the languages shipped
  with the card, plus `scripts/check-translations.js` to validate that
  every language file has the same keys as the English reference —
  wired into the `Validate HACS` CI workflow. Documented in the README
  under "Languages" as the path for contributing a new translation
  (no code changes required).

## [1.2.3] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- White flash on the chart every ~60 seconds during periodic data refresh.
  `_histLoading` was a Lit reactive property, so setting it to `true` at the
  start of every fetch triggered a full re-render that momentarily replaced
  the chart with the loading placeholder — visible as a white flash.
  Fix: `_histLoading` is no longer a reactive property; re-renders are
  triggered manually via `requestUpdate()` only when data actually arrives.
  The loading placeholder is shown only during the very first fetch (when
  no history data exists yet); subsequent silent refreshes keep the existing
  chart visible until new data is ready.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- Blank chart area requiring a page reload to recover. Three root causes:
  1. The refresh logic ran inside `updated()`, which Lit calls after every
     reactive property change. Setting `_histLoading = true` triggered a
     re-render, which triggered `updated()` again while hass kept updating
     in the background, causing cascading fetch calls.
  2. There was no concurrency guard: two `_fetchHistory()` calls running in
     parallel would write to `_history` and `_histLoading` out of order,
     producing inconsistent state visible as repeated flickering followed by
     a blank chart.
  3. Any network/API error inside `_fetchHistory()` left `_histLoading`
     permanently set to `true`, showing only the loading placeholder.
  The fetch cycle is now driven by `setInterval` started in
  `connectedCallback` and cleared in `disconnectedCallback`. A `_fetching`
  flag prevents concurrent calls, and a try/finally block ensures
  `_histLoading` is always reset even on error.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- The `icon_mode` field was missing from the visual editor when editing an
  existing card without an icon already set, making the option undiscoverable.
  It is now always shown.
- The chart sensor selector bug from 1.2.0 was only fixed in the card itself,
  not in the visual editor (which keeps its own separate copy of the
  configuration): on first enabling the chart, the editor's checkboxes still
  appeared empty even though the chart correctly showed all sensors. The
  editor now applies the same defaulting logic as the card.

### Changed
- History chart data is now downsampled (averaged into fixed time bins,
  roughly one point per 4 px of chart width) before the smoothing curve is
  drawn. Raw History API data can be noisy with many closely-spaced state
  changes; without downsampling the smoothed curve still looked jagged. The
  chart is now visually calmer and closer to other popular history-graph
  cards, regardless of how many raw data points the sensor produced.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Optional `icon` next to the card title, or replacing it entirely
  (`icon_mode: beside` / `replace`), selectable via the visual editor's icon
  picker. The stub configuration now suggests a default tank icon.

### Changed
- History chart curves are now smoothed using Catmull-Rom interpolation
  (converted to cubic Béziers), matching the look of popular history-graph
  cards instead of straight-segment lines.

### Fixed
- The chart sensor multi-select could get out of sync with the rendered
  chart: on first enabling the chart, all configured sensors were drawn but
  none appeared selected in the editor — selecting one made the others
  disappear, and deselecting it left an empty chart area. `chart_sensors` is
  now always explicitly populated with all configured sensors as soon as the
  chart is enabled, so editor and rendering stay consistent from the start.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- Chart configuration fields (`show_chart`, `chart_position`, `chart_hours`,
  `chart_style`, `chart_sensors`) were not localized in the visual editor and
  always showed up in English regardless of the Home Assistant language. The
  editor's label resolver now covers all chart-related fields.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- Translation error on graphical editor window.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Optional history chart rendered below or above the tank (configurable).
- Selectable history period: 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h.
- Two chart styles: area (filled) or lines only.
- Selector to choose which configured sensors appear in the chart.
- When the chart is active and more than one series is shown, the tank dots
  switch to fixed series colors (red / orange / blue) to match the chart
  legend, instead of the temperature-ramp color.
- History data fetched via HA REST History API; auto-refreshed every 60 s.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- Visual buffer-tank (puffer) card for Home Assistant / Lovelace.
- Display of 1 to 3 temperatures at different heights; values are distributed
  evenly over the tank when fewer than three are configured.
- Color-coded thermal stratification (blue → cyan → amber → red) driven by the
  configurable `min_temp` / `max_temp` range.
- `normal` and `compact` layouts, selectable from the visual editor.
- `show_labels` option to show values only (labels hidden).
- Customizable labels with localized defaults.
- Click any value to open the entity's more-info dialog.
- Built-in graphical editor (ha-form), no YAML required.
- Multilingual UI (English / Italian) loaded from external per-language files
  under `dist/translations/`, with a built-in English fallback so the UI never
  shows raw keys.
- Theme-aware styling.
