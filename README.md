A custom [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) **Lovelace card** that
visually represents a **buffer tank / hot-water cylinder** (a "puffer") used for
heating and domestic hot water. It shows up to four temperatures at different
heights and colors the tank according to the real thermal stratification.

## Features

- Shows **1 to 4 temperatures**; with fewer than four values they are spread
  evenly over the tank height.
- **Color-coded stratification**: each level is colored from blue (cold) to red
  (hot), based on configurable `min`/`max` temperatures.
- **Customizable labels**, with sensible localized defaults.
- **Two layouts**: `normal` (full tank) and `compact` (mini tank + value list).
- **Option to hide labels** and show values only.
- Optional **icon** next to the title, or replacing it entirely.
- **Optional history chart** below or above the tank, with selectable period
  (2 h – 48 h), smooth area or line style, and per-sensor visibility.
- Click any value to open the entity's **more-info** dialog.
- Built-in **graphical editor** — no YAML required.
- **Multilingual** UI (English / Italian, more welcome) following Home Assistant's language.
- Adapts to Home Assistant **themes**.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

Puffer Card is part of the [HACS default repositories](https://github.com/hacs/default),
so there is no custom repository to add.

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant.
2. Search for **Puffer Card** and open it.
3. Click **Download**, then reload your browser.
4. The Lovelace resource is registered automatically.

### Manual

1. Download `puffer-card.js` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/naked-head/puffer-card/releases/latest)
   and copy it to `/config/www/puffer-card/puffer-card.js`. That single file is
   all you need: Lit and every translation are bundled inside it, so the card
   works offline and pulls nothing from a CDN.
2. Go to **Settings → Dashboards → ⋮ → Resources → Add resource**:
   - URL: `/local/puffer-card/puffer-card.js`
   - Type: **JavaScript Module**
3. Reload the page.

> Upgrading from 1.3.0 or earlier? The old `translations/` folder next to
> `puffer-card.js` is no longer read and can be deleted.

## Configuration

Add a card to your dashboard, search for **Puffer Card**, and use the visual
editor — or configure it in YAML:

```yaml
type: custom:puffer-card
name: Heating buffer
icon: mdi:propane-tank-outline   # optional
icon_mode: beside                # "beside" or "replace"
layout: normal           # "normal" or "compact"
show_labels: true        # set to false to show values only
min_temp: 20            # temperature mapped to the cold color
max_temp: 80            # temperature mapped to the hot color
top:
  entity: sensor.buffer_top
  label: Flow
middle:
  entity: sensor.buffer_middle
  label: Storage
extra:
  entity: sensor.buffer_extra
  label: Extra
bottom:
  entity: sensor.buffer_bottom
  label: Return
show_chart: true        # optional history chart
chart_position: below   # "below" or "above"
chart_hours: 24         # 2, 6, 12, 24 or 48
chart_style: area       # "area" or "line"
chart_sensors:          # which positions to include in the chart
  - top
  - middle
  - extra
  - bottom
```

To show **fewer than four values**, simply omit the positions you don't need
(for example only `top` and `bottom`). The displayed values are then
distributed evenly over the tank. With all four positions configured, the
tank grows slightly taller and badge text shrinks a little so nothing
overlaps — layouts with 1 to 3 sensors are unaffected.

## Layouts

### Normal

The full tank with value badges on the side.

### Compact

A small tank next to a compact list of values — ideal for dense dashboards.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naked-head/puffer-card/main/images/compact.png" alt="Compact layout" width="420">

### Values only (labels hidden)

With `show_labels: false` the labels are removed. In the compact layout the
values move next to the tank.

### Even distribution

When you configure fewer than four values, they are evenly distributed over the
tank height instead of staying at the extremes.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naked-head/puffer-card/main/images/two-sensors.png" alt="Two values evenly distributed" width="420">

### Four sensors

With all four positions configured, the tank is taller and badge text is a bit
smaller so the four values stay comfortably spaced; side pipes follow the
number of configured sensors instead of a fixed pair.

## History chart

When `show_chart: true` a history chart is rendered below (or above) the tank,
fetching data from the HA History API. Curves are smoothed (Catmull-Rom
interpolation), similar to other popular history-graph cards. Each sensor is
drawn in a fixed color (red, orange, blue) that doubles as the legend.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naked-head/puffer-card/main/images/chart-normal.png" alt="Normal layout with history chart" width="420">

When the chart is active and more than one sensor is shown, the colored dots on
the tank and in the compact list switch to the same fixed colors, linking the
live reading to the corresponding chart line.

## Languages

The UI language follows Home Assistant's own language setting, with English
as the fallback when a translation is missing or a language isn't available
at all.

Translations live under `src/translations/`: one JSON file per language.
They are compiled into `dist/puffer-card.js` at build time, so the card never
fetches them at runtime.

```
src/
├── i18n.js              # registry: which languages ship with the card
└── translations/
    ├── en.json          # reference language — every key must exist here
    └── it.json
```

**To contribute a new language:**

1. Copy `src/translations/en.json` to `src/translations/<code>.json` (use the
   language's [IETF tag](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/#language),
   e.g. `de.json` for German) and translate the values — keep the keys as-is.
2. Register it in `src/i18n.js`: add the `import` line and the entry in
   `TRANSLATIONS`.
3. Run `npm run check` — this rebuilds the bundle and verifies that the
   registry, the files on disk and the built bundle all agree, and that no key
   from `en.json` is missing. (Missing keys don't break anything: they silently
   fall back to English. The script catches typos and gaps before you open a
   PR.) The same check runs automatically in CI.
4. Commit the regenerated `dist/puffer-card.js` along with your changes, then
   open a pull request.

## Development

The card is bundled with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). `src/` is the
source of truth; `dist/puffer-card.js` is generated and committed.

```bash
npm install       # once
npm run build     # src/ -> dist/puffer-card.js
npm run check     # build, then validate translations and the bundle
```

Always commit the rebuilt `dist/puffer-card.js` together with any change under
`src/`: CI fails if the two are out of sync. The version string is injected at
build time — from the git tag on releases, from `package.json` otherwise — so
there is no version constant to edit by hand in the source.

## Color scale

Each temperature is mapped to a color between `min_temp` (blue) and `max_temp`
(red), passing through cyan, amber and orange. Tune `min_temp` / `max_temp` to
match your system so the colors are meaningful for your typical operating range.
